## CompileJasperTemplate

This is a simple Sublime Text 3 plugin to allow you to quickly and easily compile your JRXML files into Jasper templates. This plugin assumes you have the [JasperStarter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperstarter/files/) package installed and findable in your $PATH.

Run the plugin with the context menu or with the `super+shift+j` and the current file will be run through the `jasperstarter` command. At the moment there is no feedback or confirmation that the command was successful. Maybe version 0.2.0.
